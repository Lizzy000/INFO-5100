ArrayList is based on array, which means after you delete an element, you have to move other elements behinds the deleted element forward.
LinkedList is based on nodes, so when you delete one element, you just change the next pointer of the node before the deleted node.


ArrayList has index, so it's much easier to retrive an element based on an index;
LinkedList doesn't have index, when you get an element, you have to move pointer.
