if use "final" to define a class,the class cannot be extended. Or a variable or method defined by"final",
it means the variable/method cannot be changed/overrided by subclasses.

but "finally"  appears in an exception. When use "try" and "catch" to catch possible exception, 
no matter the "catch" words being executed or not,
the "finally" words will be executed whatever.
